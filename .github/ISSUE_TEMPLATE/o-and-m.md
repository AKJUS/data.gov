As part of day-to-day operation of Data.gov, there are many [Operation and Maintenance (O&M) responsibilities](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-deploy/wiki/Operation-and-Maintenance-Responsibilities). Instead of having the entire team watching notifications and risking some notifications slipping through the cracks, we have created an [O&M Triage role](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-deploy/wiki/Operation-and-Maintenance-Responsibilities#om-triage-rotation). One person on the team is assigned the Triage role which rotates each sprint. _This is not meant to be a 24/7 responsibility, only East Coast business hours. If you are unavailable, please note when you will be unavailable in Slack and ask for someone to take on the role for that time._

Each day, you should start your triage by looking through the notification channels for anything **urgent** that came in after hours that might need immediate attention:

- [#datagov-alerts](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/C4RGAM1Q8) may contain critical host alerts
- [Bug bounty report (ad-hoc email)](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-deploy/wiki/Operation-and-Maintenance-Responsibilities#bug-bounty-report-ad-hoc-email)
- [Vulnerable dependency notifications (daily email reports)](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-deploy/wiki/Operation-and-Maintenance-Responsibilities#vulnerable-dependency-notifications-daily-email-reports)
