          We accept the risk for this moderate severity information exposure
          issue. Our logs are secured on our jumpbox servers where only
          authorized team members have access. We expect a fix to be made
          available on the 2.8.x branch soon.

          There is no fix for PyYaml at this time. YAML playbooks are
          considered trusted and run only on our secured jumpboxes by our
          operators.  These operators should only be using trusted sources as
          well.  Risk is acceptable.
